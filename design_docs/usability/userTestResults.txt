User testing results

For user testing several think alouds were performed.  For this style of
user testing a novice user is given several tasks to complete using the app. 
They vocalize their thoughts while performing the tasks.  Normally someone
would go back and view a screen capture and audio recording to 
record usability problems.  In this case we watched the participants 
and recorded changes that need to be made. Results of things that need
to be changed are below.

1. when the map is first shown show the info window for the house being 
   searched
2. show an appropriate error message, or handle if zilllow doesn't have
   information on that house.
3. make the navbar consistent from page to page
4. make filtering occur dynamically(shouldn't need to press a button)
5. clear results if the user returns to search-start fresh
6. have a clear method of returning to the map after filtering.
        -most users scrolled to the bottom of the page looking for a return
         button
7. add a short description on the home page
